# Gnirehtet (v2.5)

This project provides **reverse tethering** over `adb` for Android: it
allows devices to use the internet connection of the computer they are plugged
on. It does not require any _root_ access (neither on the device nor on the
computer). It works on _GNU/Linux_, _Windows_ and _Mac OS_.

Currently, it relays [TCP] and [UDP] over [IPv4] traffic, but it does not
support [IPv6] (yet?).

[UDP]: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol
[IPv4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4
[IPv6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6


## Flavors

Two implementations of _Gnirehtet_ are available:
 - one in **Java**;
 - one in **Rust**.


### Which one to choose?

Use the **Rust** implementation. The native binary consumes less CPU and memory,
and does not require a _Java_ runtime environment.

The relay server of _Gnirehtet_ was initially only implemented in Java. As a
benefit, the same "binary" runs on every platform having _Java 8_ runtime
installed. It is still maintained to provide a working alternative in case of
problems with the Rust version.


## Requirements

The Android application requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

For the _Java_ version only, _Java 8_ (JRE) is required on your computer. On
Debian-based distros, install the package `openjdk-8-jre`.

### adb

You need a recent version of [adb] (where `adb reverse` is implemented, it
works with 1.0.36).

It is available in the [Android SDK platform tools][platform-tools].

On Debian-based distros, you can alternatively install the package
`android-tools-adb`.

On Windows, if you need `adb` only for this application, just download the
[platform-tools][platform-tools-windows] and extract the following files to the
_gnirehtet_ directory:
 - `adb.exe`
 - `AdbWinApi.dll`
 - `AdbWinUsbApi.dll`

Make sure you [enabled adb debugging][enable-adb] on your device(s).

## Get the app

### Homebrew

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), getting up and running is very quick.
To install the Rust version:

```
brew install gnirehtet
```

### Download

Download the [latest release][latest] in the flavor you want.

Then extract it.

The Linux and MacOS archives contain:
 - `gnirehtet.apk`
 - `gnirehtet`

The Windows archive contains:
 - `gnirehtet.apk`
 - `gnirehtet.exe`
 - `gnirehtet-run.cmd`


#### Java

 - **All platforms:** [`gnirehtet-java-v2.5.zip`][direct-java]  
   (SHA-256: _c65fc1a35e6b169ab6aa45e695c043e933f6fd650363aea7c2add0ecb0db27ca_)

[direct-java]: https://github.com/Genymobile/gnirehtet/releases/download/v2.5/gnirehtet-java-v2.5.zip

Then extract it. The archive contains:
 - `gnirehtet.apk`
 - `gnirehtet.jar`
 - `gnirehtet`
 - `gnirehtet.cmd`
 - `gnirehtet-run.cmd`


## Run (simple)

_Note: On Windows, replace `./gnirehtet` by `gnirehtet` in the following
commands._

The application has no UI, and is intended to be controlled from the computer
only.

If you want to activate reverse tethering for exactly one device, just execute:

    ./gnirehtet run

Reverse tethering remains active until you press _Ctrl+C_.

On Windows, for convenience, you can double-click on `gnirehtet-run.cmd`
instead (it just executes `gnirehtet run`, without requiring to open a
terminal).

The very first start should open a popup to request permission:

![request](assets/request.jpg)

A "key" logo appears in the status bar whenever _Gnirehtet_ is active:

![key](assets/key.png)

Alternatively, you can enable reverse tethering for all connected devices
(present and future) by calling:

    ./gnirehtet autorun


## Run

You can execute the actions separately (it may be useful if you want to reverse
tether several devices simultaneously).

Start the relay server and keep it open:

    ./gnirehtet relay

Install the `apk` on your Android device:

    ./gnirehtet install [serial]

In another terminal, for each client, execute:

    ./gnirehtet start [serial]

To stop a client:

    ./gnirehtet stop [serial]

To reset the tunnel (useful to get the connection back when a device is
unplugged and plugged back while gnirehtet is active):

    ./gnirehtet tunnel [serial]

The _serial_ parameter is required only if `adb devices` outputs more than one
device.

For advanced options, call `./gnirehtet` without arguments to get more details.


## Run manually

The `gnirehtet` program exposes a simple command-line interface that executes
lower-level commands. You can call them manually instead.

To start the relay server:

    ./gnirehtet relay

To install the apk:

    adb install -r gnirehtet.apk

To start a client:

    adb reverse localabstract:gnirehtet tcp:31416
    adb shell am start -a com.genymobile.gnirehtet.START \
        -n com.genymobile.gnirehtet/.GnirehtetActivity

To stop a client:

    adb shell am start -a com.genymobile.gnirehtet.STOP \
        -n com.genymobile.gnirehtet/.GnirehtetActivity


## Environment variables

`ADB` defines a custom path to the `adb` executable:

```bash
ADB=/path/to/my/adb ./gnirehtet run
```

`GNIREHTET_APK` defines a custom path to `gnirehtet.apk`:

```bash
GNIREHTET_APK=/usr/share/gnirehtet/gnirehtet.apk ./gnirehtet run
```


## Why _gnirehtet_?

    rev <<< tethering

(in _Bash_)
